# Matura Projects
While preparing for the matura exam, I was looking for a new language that would increase my productivity in solving exam problems easier and faster. I found Python actually much better suited to this kind of problem, so I switched to it right away (with C ++ which, while much faster to compute, is also much slower to write, especially when the clock is ticking and problems need a simple solution, such as one Python built-in function). This repository shows my work and the path to the best Matura exam grades.
